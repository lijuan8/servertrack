Restful service for tracking and displaying server's cpu and memory run on Tomcat 8.

Set up tomcat: (on my mac)

First make sure 8080 is not being used now.

1) downloads tomcat from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi 
2) sudo mkdir -p /usr/local
3) sudo mv ~/Download/apache-tomcat-8.0.32 /usr/local
4) sudo rm -f /Library/Tomcat
5) sudo ln -s /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.32 /Library/Tomcat
6) sudo chown -R lyang9 /Library/Tomcat
7) sudo chmod +x /Library/Tomcat/bin/*.sh
8) add the folloing to /Library/Tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml

  <role rolename="tomcat" />
  <role rolename="manager-gui" />
  <role rolename="manager-script" />
  <role rolename="admin-gui" />
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcatuser" roles="tomcat,manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script" />

 9) start tomcat: 
   /Library/Tomcat/bin/startup.sh
 10) verify tomcat is up:
   http://localhost:8080/
 11) tomcat log files are under /Library/Tomcat/logs in case of something is not right
 12) run following comming to build the project (war file is created)
     mvn clean test package
 13) deploy service
     mvn tomcat7:redeploy
 14) check 
     curl -XGET 'http://localhost:8080/servertrack/rest/display/server1/2016-01-01-10-01/10/m' should get an [] result.

testing:

 ./scripts/post.sh: will post data in load.txt to server
       Specific Note: for a specific server, data posted to server much be in timely manner. Otherwise it might cause issues.

 ./scripts/get.sh: will make get requests from request.txt and write to file test.result.

 At the end, run /Library/Tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh to shutdown tomcat.
